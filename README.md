Key Game Considerations
---

- Should players be able to walk through each other?
NO

- How does combat work?
-- If an enemy enters the "circle" of the player, the player starts "swinging".
-- The "hit" player "pinball" bounces off of the "hiter"

- "Boost / sprint ability"
-- Burns XP

- Upon death
-- The "killer" gets 25% experience + 25% - 50% dropped on the ground
